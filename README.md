Cargo Cars is a simple [React](reactjs.org) app collecting all possible CEO car combinations from popular [Rocktar's GTA Online](www.rockstargames.com/GTAOnline) video game. Made to make checking if specific car is inside any collection much easier. Made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

# Running Locally

You can learn how to use Create React App [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). `yarn` is preferred over `npm`. After cloning repo you can run `yarn start` to run app locally.

Pull requests and issues are welcome! App is small so automated testing is unnecessary
